## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Game Result
Users will be rewarded by 3 stars if finished within 16 moves, and 2 stars if within 21 moves, 1 star if within 24 moves, otherwise no star will be rewarded.
